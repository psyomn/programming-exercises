Draw a line... except it must be your implementation of a line using only the ability to draw a point. Think implementing a line is too easy? Try it :). You can output the result in ASCII text if you'd like instead of using a graphics library. A successful implementation will be able to draw [this](http://imgur.com/a8LuR). Only being able to draw horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines is not enough, and the lines can't contain any holes. Also, if you're drawing a line (I'll use drawLine(x1, y1, x2, y2) as an example) using the following call: drawLine(100, 10, 200, 300), then the following call must draw the same line: drawLine(200, 300, 100, 10).
