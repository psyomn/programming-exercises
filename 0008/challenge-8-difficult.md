Write a program that will take coordinates, and tell you the corresponding number in pascals triangle. For example:

Input: 1, 1

output:1

* * *

input: 4, 2

output: 3

* * *

input: 1, 19

output: error/nonexistent/whatever

* * *

the format should be "line number, integer number"

for extra credit, add a function to simply print the triangle, for the extra credit to count, it must print at least 15 lines.
