[Sokoban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban) is an old PC puzzle game that involves pushing boxes onto goal squares in a puzzling warehouse layout. Write your own simple Sokoban clone (using a GUI, or curses) that can read level files in [.xsb format](http://sokosolve.sourceforge.net/FileFormatXSB.html) from the command line and play them.

For extra credit, extend your program to include a level editor, allowing the user to draw his own levels and save them as .xsb files.
