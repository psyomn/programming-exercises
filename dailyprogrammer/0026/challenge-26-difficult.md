Create a piece of code that downloads an entire album from imgur. It should support multiple arguments. e.g.

imgurDownloader [http://imgur.com/a/0NZBe](http://imgur.com/a/0NZBe) [http://imgur.com/a/OKduw](http://imgur.com/a/OKduw)

The url might get a bit redundant for large batch's, so consider leaving out the link, so one just needs to enter 0NZBe OKduw ect. You can use a third party librarys.

Tip: every single image link in an album is listed in the source code.

Bonus points: You can enter the directory you would like to save the files but it's optional. Extra bonus points: if you can change all the file-names into something readable, that's also customizable. For example if I wanted all my images called wallpapers_001, wallpapers\_002, ect. I would just add wallpapers_# as an argument.
