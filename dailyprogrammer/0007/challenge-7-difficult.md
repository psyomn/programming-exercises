This challenge will focus on creating a bot that can log into Reddit!

Write a program that can log into a working Reddit account.

Since this challenge is vague, bonus points are awarded for a few different things:

-

If the bot can navigate the site and view posts

-

If the bot can make posts

-

If the bot can make statistics from the front page/any subreddit. These statistics include time on front page, number of comments, upvotes, downvotes, etc.

The more functionality in your bot, the better.
