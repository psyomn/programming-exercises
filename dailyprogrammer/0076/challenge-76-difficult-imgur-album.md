Write a script that takes an [imgur](http://imgur.com) album id and an output directory as command line arguments (e.g., `./script DeOSG ./images` ), and saves all images from the album in the output directory as `DeOSG-1.jpg` , `DeOSG-2.jpg` , etc.

**Hint**: To retrieve the picture URLs, parse the HTML page at " `http://imgur.com/a/` **(ID)** `/layout/blog` ".
